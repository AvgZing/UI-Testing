# BanUI

> Version: v1.0.0-beta

> PocketMine-MP: api-3.0.0-ALPHA9

> Minecraft: v1.2.x

# This plugin is not tested 100% and is still a W.I.P
we do not recommend anyone to use this plugin at the moment,

issues may be ignored if you choose to use this plugin.

# what is working?
well you can ban people but you cannot unban them

also there is no config

and gui's have no been tested and confirmed to work yet.
